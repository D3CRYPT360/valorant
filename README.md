# Valorant Third Party Toolkit

This repository contains unofficial Valorant documentation and tools for third party developers.
Our goal is to centralize our community's effort into a single repository containing:

- Documentation on the local Riot client API
- Documentation on official and unofficial Valorant remote endpoints
- Documentation on the Valorant game itself and relevant package data
- Scripts for collecting data about the game and its runtime
- Scripts for testing remote API endpoints

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please submit a pull request. 
If you would like to maintain this repository, feel free to reach out to me.
When contributing, please try to match the style of existing documents in this repository.
Our goal is for them to be readable both in plaintext format and as rendered markdown.
Some guidelines:

- Sentences should go on separate lines.
  In my experience, this makes file diffs much more meaningful, especially for pull requests.
  It also avoids most issues that arise while trying to manually wrap text.
- Use concise file names that reflect the format of surrounding files.
  Titles should be `lower-kebab-case.md`.
  The only exception is `README.md`, which should be titled as written.
